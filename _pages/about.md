Welcome to my homepage! I am a Ph.D. student in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech. I am a research assistant in the Network Science, Wireless, and Security group at Virginia Tech (NetSciWiS@VT). I am also a Wireless@VT Fellow.

I received my B.Sc. with honors in Electrical Engineering, Control and Robotics Systems and Communication Systems (double major) from the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) and my M.Sc. in Communication Systems from University of Tehran.

My research interests include Sample efficiency and generalization in deep reinforcement learning, generalization in neural networks, and stochastic/robust optimization, with their applications in communications and networking.
